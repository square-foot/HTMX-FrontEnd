# HTMX-FrontEnd
Here are some frontend examples for productive, rapid use of HTMX.

To begin with I developed a simple TOML "Editor" by working on simple HTML Textarea 

====But why?====

I was tired of creating front end input boxes, checkboxes, etc and the complications
and time involved in them. Then I thought how about emulating a simple ruled paper?
After all, when we fill data manually (i.e. without a computer) we simply tear
a ruled paper and enter the data systematically one below the other on those lines.

So as a start, here is a simple method by which the user can send a TOML data 
to a server -- and TOML is quite good to capture a lot of complex JSON obj.

According to me, this simple and quite useful. Your experience may vary.
This was written in a day, and so expect some errors. But I think I have
tested this reasonably well. Your experience may vary.

The actual docs are in the HTML source: The source has the force, Luke.
Read ALL the comments and I think you should be good to go.

Best wishes.
